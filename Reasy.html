           <h2>Overview</h2>
           <p>This problem arised when my college has no other option but to submit written forms to Student's Council to reserve a community hall or club room for an event. Rather than going all the way to the Admin building they can simply use a mobile application to reserve a hall or club room. I had this idea for a long time but after hearing about the hectic process of booking a hall for an activity from my peers, I ventured to make this a reality. This is just a concept but covers the whole user experience and journey. I am no developer but I would love to see this application pop up in the app stores as this would greatly benefit users and make the whole “hectic” club room booking experience much easier. So I decided to use this opportunity and solve this problem by designing an easy and unique experience for users. </p>
           <p>Registered clubs have the privilege of reserving rooms on campus for meetings and events sponsored by their organization. Reservable spaces include the Auditoriums, Student Activity Center, Available Classroom Space, Outdoor Event Space, and other campus venues listed by the campus. The main principle behind this product was to simplify the whole experience and process of reserving a club room for an event.</p>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
           <p> <strong>Design a simple app for students to book community halls and club rooms for their respective events.</strong> </p>

               <h2>The Problem</h2>
               <p>Before anything else, what is the problem that I am trying to solve with my design. More importantly, is there a need for this?I spoke with my peers and some members of our college council members and club presidents and they told me about their troublesome and confusing reserving a club room is. And <strong>YES! </strong>there's absolute need for an application like this in our college.</p>
               
                <p>The problems you think users may have are not always what they truly face.<br>

Most of the time what we think will be the problem, will be different from real problem. A large part of the current issue is due to the lack of centralization of reservation system across the different departments and clubs. Our College has more than 50 departments and clubs combined and it’s difficult to merge all departments into a single reservation system.</p>
                
              <p>To plan for an event, students have to first decide which club room they want to reserve. Post this decision, they have to choose the date and which event they would like to conduct and the runtime of the event. This process often requires some back and forth in order to settle on the ideal date, venue and time. This long process can often be tedious when making ad-hoc plans.</p></div></div>

          <div class="col-md-12 probootstrap-animate">
                
                <p>I concluded that the main issues were that:
                
              </p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Going all the way from club rooms to admin building is troublesome and if they want to cancel the plan they have to do the same.</li><br>
                   <li>Knowing which club is hosting what event in which hall is also a big pain point. They don't want jamming of events as they want students to participate in their events as well.</li>
               </ol>
               <h4>Functional Requirements:</h4>
               <ol>
                   <li>Members and staff can make reservations of club rooms and community halls.</li>
                   <li>Members can check the status of their reservations.</li>
                   <li>Members can check the history of their reservations.</li>
               </ol>
                <p>In my previous projects I always used to competitor analysis of other apps to look up the trends and information architecture. But for this problem there were no such apps to do analysis so I just took my design decisions on pure instinct. Although I did look into the system of other reservation apps. </p>

            <p>I conducted a brief audit of other reservation apps and services that did not necessarily target reserving academic spaces, in order to get
a better grasp on reservation processes in general. One notable example was OpenTable, a service for placing reservations at restaurants.</p>

           <h2>User Research</h2>
           
            
            <h4>Contextual Inquiries</h4>
            <p>Over the course of a few days, I reached out to 30 different classmates and 3 professors
through both online and face-to-face interactions to get opinions on the most relevant
information about university spaces. I also sent out an online form through various social media
channels and collected 16 responses.</p>
            <h4>Interviews-relevant information about Spaces</h4>
            <p>Some of the questions I asked in regards to information about university spaces were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What would you say is the most relevant information about
an academic building or hall?</strong></li>
              <br> <p>- Printing and Xerox status</p>
              <p>- Academic schedule and university information</p>
              <p>- I'd say this depends on what I'm currently trying to do at the building. For example if I'm trying to work in an open place, say for example digital library, I'd like to know how many people already signed in to that so that I don't need to waste time     going there. Otherwise, if I'm just looking for a place to sit and work, I need to know what rooms have currently classes going on and what rooms are empty and when will be classes next in these rooms.I'd also like to know what professors are around at that building and their time of being at that building.</p>
               <p>- location</p>
               <p>- Availability</p>
               <p>- Parking lot</p>
               <p>- Canteen and food centers available</p>
               <p>- Map</p>
               <p>- The layout of the building and what type of classes are being taught at that place. Students should know whether they need to check-in the building or not.</p>
                <li><strong>What would you say is the most relevant information about
a non-academic building or hall (student center, music
practice room, stage, etc)?</strong></li> <br>
               <p>For this question the same I got same answers as above.</p>
                <li><strong>What are some frustrations you experience in university
settings in regards to resources, technology, spaces,
communication, etc?</strong></li>
               <br>
               <p>- Lacking. All of it lacking</p>
               <p>- Parking space</p>
               <p>- Security people searching us and not allowing us when it's night time</p>
               <p>- empty spaces</p>
               <p>- I find computer labs often being crowded. And the equipment being broken like broken lan cables, mouse etc.</p>
               
               <li><strong>What's your idea about a university app?</strong></li><br>
               <p>- Being simple and functional, I don't need too much unncessary info.</p>
               <p>- Maybe showing the events, seminars, university activities in a timeline. </p>
               <p>- Renewing our library books with the app would be a big help.</p>
                
            </ol>
             </div></div>

          <div class="col-md-12 probootstrap-animate">
               <h4>Interview Insights</h4>
               <p>From the online, in-person, and survey responses, I pulled out a few recurring insights about
relevant information of a location and the reservation process within the university.</p>
             <strong>General Information</strong>
               <p>Most people agreed that the most important general information about a university-related location included:</p>
               <ul >
                   <li> Hours</li>
                   <li> Location</li>
                   <li> Neay by areas</li>
                   <li> Accessibility</li>
                   <li>Services</li>
               </ul>
               
               <strong>Availability</strong>
               <p>In regards to availability,
people tended to care most
about how many people
were in a room, seating
capacity, and parking
spaces.</p>
               
               <strong>Wait time</strong>
               <p>The time taken to receive
a reservation
confirmation can be long
and unpleasant,
especially when working
with university-run
organizations.</p>
               
               <strong>Contextual
Information</strong>
               <p>While looking for a space,
context of why the person
wants the space is important
to keep in mind. Wanting a
room for studying is different
from wanting the same room
for a club meeting, event
venue, etc.</p>
                </div></div>

               <h2>User Persona</h2>
               <p>I was designing an experience primarily for students and professors, so I created four different
user personas that embodied different needs during the reservation process. Unlike in my previous project I didn't use images and demographics in user personas. They don't help us empathise because they feel completely generic and staged (I did use the persona's pain points and needs as a reference but never really felt anything about the photo or the demographics of the fictional person, I just thought it's necessary to keep an image of the character we're keeping in mind. But that's not the case). But maybe not all photos need be like this. Finding a perfect picture that fits our scenario is hard, so I skipped them. For my next project I plan on using fictional sketches as the embodiment of my character. But as of now I don't want to use my time as the deadline is a week.</p>

          <h4>Grouping The Data : Affinity Mapping</h4>
          <p>Based on the interviews and present app trends and everything related to room reserving services, I wrote them down on some notes and grouped them on functionality basis. I wrote whatever ideas I got, it was a mini brainstorming session for me. The affinity mapping experience was outstanding, I was doing all by myself and was overwhelmed by the thoughts and UI options I was thinking. I listed each idea on individual notes and later grouped them. I used to write the ideas on notebook and circled the same functional with coloured sketches. </p>

experience might work. I took my notes from Affinity Mapping as a foundation.</p>

               <h2>User Testing - Mid-Fi Mockups</h2>
               <p>I was able to have four college students test different early prototype iterations made in
InVision for the process of reserving spaces of a school in a mobile app. While I wish I could have had more time and resources to create more iterations and
tests, I was still able to get a lot of valuable feedback from my user testing sessions. Although No one has give me any deadline, it's the time limit I kept to myself, to test my potential. Some
of the main recurring insights I found are shown below:</p>
               <p>- The first flow of looking through filters in the Search Bar feels a little
overwhelming -- try condensing a bit or separating the information more
into sub-categories or drop-downs.</p>
              <p>- The “Nearest Available” section is slightly misleading.</p>
              
               <p>- Consider adding helper text for each module.</p>
               <p>- Always display confirmations after changing the filter settings of a search.</p>
               <p>- Is the ‘Nearby food/coffee/stores’ necessary in the filter section?</p>
               <p>- The interface itself should be the Search process itself. Anything more than that
gets confusing and bogged down.</p>
               <p>- The down menu section seems unnecessary. The concept of the app is simple
enough to have everything live on the main “Home” page.</p>

                   <h2>User Testing - Scrapped Ideas</h2>
                   <p>I received a lot of helpful feedback during the process of user testing and ended up scrapping a few of the early concepts I thought about
including in my design.</p>

Student or Teacher</h3>
                     <p>I originally thought of the idea of
being able to search the status
of another student or teacher
for the purpose of finding
classmates and teammates, but
decided to omit it for privacy
and safety reasons.</p>

(In-Class, Busy,
Off-Campus, etc)</h3>
                     <p>This feature would also tie into
searching for a classmate or
professor to work with, but
people are typically already
connected with their
group-mates through other
messaging platforms, so I
figured this would be
unnecessary.</p>

Coffee and Food</h3>
                     <p>While I thought this would be
interesting to include in the
results page of a space, but I did
not want to bog down the MVP
with too many features and
decided to focus on school
resources and rooms.</p>

                        <p>Kiosks are placed around the school at the front of each building, and utilize a simple touch interface.</p>
                        <p>Students and teachers can search for resources and spaces
with names or keywords. The “Quick Search” feature
displays a list of search suggestions, based on the user’s
preferences and past activity.  Students and teachers scan their school I.D. cards to enter
rooms so Reasy is able to know the amount of people at any
given space.
I.D. cards can also be used to sign into the kiosk at the school’s
new Student Center to search availability and reserve spaces
without the mobile app.</p>

                       <h2>Conclusion and Takeaways</h2>
                       <p>At this point this project is far from complete, with a one man team at my level I coundn't complete the full-fledged prototype, the sub-functionalities and the micro interactions are being left. The thoughts on my next project is to have a 10 day timeline and to complete the fully functional prototype including micro interactions.</p>
                      
                       <p>One of the first speedbumps I hit
during my design process was
feeling overwhelmed by all of the
possible filters that might be
included in searching for a
location or resource. My earlier
wireframes had an extremely
dense display of filters, and the
process of sorting and
condensing all of the information
I originally wanted to display
proved to be challenging.</p>
                       <p>As I went through my design
process, I constantly had ideas
of features to add and augment
the overall experience.
However, I had to ground
myself multiple times to avoid
deviating away too much from
my original goal of reservation.</p>
                       <p>With everything said, I can feel myself constantly improving in the field of UX. Mastering the Information Architecture, the psychology of customers and working correct on a deadline  needs a lot of experience. The more I dive into the field the more I feel knowledgeable and unknowledgeable at the same time about UX and Product Strategy. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to design an experience for my fellow students. I had a lot of fun and feel as though I learned a few new things
about the mental model of reservation in general.</p>
                       <p>I still got a long way ahead. Reading blogs and books, talking with and obverving users (a lot.....) and forming product and UI strategies, constantly improving myself is the main and long-term goal.....</p>
