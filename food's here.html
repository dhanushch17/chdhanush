          <p><strong>Food's Here</strong> is a mobile app designed to give users a fine and pleasant dining experience. This case study explains the thought process of designing a food ordering app that users find easily usable in their daily life. I took inspiration from <strong>Swiggy</strong> the food ordering app in India and redesigned it so that it can be more useful to users.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Over the last 30 or so years, people's eating habits have changed a lot. Technology and 
the internet played the main role and contributed to the changes in consumer preferences 
as their dependence on technology made them get everything online including getting cooked
 meals delivered to their doorstep. Probably, this is one of the reasons why the mobile applications for ordering
 food(from breakfast to brunch, dinner to dessert) online is so popular nowadays and
 became a great source of ideas
for UX designers.</p>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>From my research beforehand about online food delivering services, the factors contributing
to their popularity were: fast deliveries, a wide range of varieties, rewards, and cash back.
It led to the designing of a more convenient, friendly and more attractive app for
              users to meet their expectations more precisely while ordering food.</p>

<p>Although the main challenge was to design an app that makes busy workers eat 
healthy and tasty food on-time. Employees these days have busy schedules from dawn to dusk and even night shifts.
They have a very high chance of missing lunch and dinner or may eat at a later time.
I decided to design a competing app, where making an order should be as simple as few
 clicks on a mobile device. The more informative and understandable the options and 
choices are, the more a user uses it and more number of users use it.</p>

             <h2>User Research</h2>
             <p>The main idea of user research is to get user's perspective, their needs and wants and their frustrations and delights.</p>
             <h4>Goals of User Research</h4>
             <ol>
                 <li><strong>Behaviour Patterns </strong> - Eating habits and timings</li>

                 <li><strong>Un-addressed Pain Points </strong> - Am I missing anything?</li>
                 <li><strong>Fine Dine Experience </strong>- Having a MVP that blends in their daily life</li>
                 <li><strong>Underlying Emotions </strong> - What makes a fine dining experience at an office like environment?</li>
             </ol>
             <p>I spent the first two days of the week researching about online food delivery services and users individually.
 I did 7 contextual inquiries with 4 busy employees (aged 25-30), 2 of my classmates (aged21), 1 of my friend (aged 22, 
 who orders food 10-15 a week). I also did a survey and got 10 responses from people aged 20-30.
</p>
             <p>I asked qualitative questions and unique stories they've encountered while ordering 
 food online, from delivery guy to food that was delivered.</p>

             <h4>User Interview Insights</h4>
              <p> During those sessions, I asked 3 of them to use their favourite app for ordering food and had them a walkthrough from
 selection of food to bill payment.
 I gave them different scenarios. During the whole thought process I asked them to tell whatever they feel and express their general thoughts. I noted things that made them think or things that they stopped at while using the app.</p>
             <p><strong>Walk me through a food order...</strong></p>
             <p><i> "I spend almost 20-30 minutes on just searching what I need."</i></p>
             <p><i>"It really depends on my mood, I usually order the same everyday and I'd like to my access favourites a lot."</i>
</p>
             <p><i>"We usually discuss among collegues and then decide."</i></p>
             <p><i>"I'd like nearby recommendations, so that I can eat quickly."</i></p>
             <p><strong>What do you think, when you're trying to decide when to eat or where to eat?</strong></p>
             <p><i>"Too lazy to go out on a free day, too busy to leave from work on a typical workday."</i>
</p>
              <p><i>"Somewhere near, 10-15 min at max."</i></p>
              <p><i>"Quality and tasty food and cheap at the same time. Although I will spend enough if the food is actually tasty."</i></p>

<ul>
              <li>The food must be tasty, healthy, affordable and authentic. No limited food options.</li>

              <li>Workers generally prefer to eat outside the office to take a break from work to get away from office environment, but not too far. The nearby restaurants shouldn't be over crowded, should be convenient to eat with colleagues, not too fat from the office.</li>

 <li> Finding what I wanna eat fast and a fast delivery.</li>
         <li>Overall dining experience should be always be satisfactory.
</li>
         <li>Positive reviews of other user create a strong impact on them.</li>

          <h4>Grouping The Data : Affinity Mapping</h4>
          <p>Based on the interviews and present app trends and everything related to food delivering services, I wrote them down on some notes and grouped them on functionality basis. I wrote whatever ideas I got, it was a mini brainstorming session for me. The affinity mapping experience was outstanding, I was doing all by myself and was overwhelmed by the thoughts and UI options I was thinking. I listed each idea on individual notes and later grouped them. I used to write the ideas on notebook and circled the same functional with coloured sketches. </p>

          <h4>Sketching And Userflow</h4>
          <p>I'm from a graphic design background so sketching wasn't a big deal (although it doesn't matter to sketch rough ideas). I started off easily sketching rough ideas of app features and use cases. </p>
          <p>Use cases take a scenario and explains the story of what happens and how the user deals with the situation. The primary actors will always be user and the app. Imagining use cases and the scenarios will help us identify the pain points and pleasure points of the user. Use cases can also help us identify the required features for the app, the pain points and pleasure points will help us identify where the user faces trouble and what should be modified.</p>
          <p>Keeping the persona in mind and evaluating the app features through use case scenarios is as useful as user testing. Here are a few  cases where I kept evaluating my thought process, while designing an experience for Regina. </p>

          <p>I imagined different scenarios about Regina's dining and looked up how <strong>Food's Here </strong> can solve these issues. I came up a complete user flow about how a typical user will use the app. This is the user journey for all the users. There can be different scenarios in the journey.</p>
          <ol>
              <li>User know exactly what to order so the user will just order.</li>
              <li>User don't know what to eat, user will follow the recommendations from the app, nearby, promos, rewards etc.</li>
              <li>User don't know what to eat, user will search by applying filters and categories.</li>
              <li>User will initiate a group chat on what to eat(mainy for colleagues, friends and family) and the user will add friends to his group chat. After discussing the group's leader will order the food.</li>
              <li>User's friend shares a link through social media and the user will be redirected to the dish page by clicking the link and then the user will order the food.</li>
               </ol>
              <p>While in a group order the users can only choose one restaurant. This will reduce the delivery time and will keep the food warm. </p>

        Each user did those tasks easily and had a smooth flow through the prototype.</p>

         <p>I added <strong>Quicky </strong> option for quick grabs. Quicky option shows users the most cheap and best deals available in their location with no deliver fee.</p>

                <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
                <p>After user testing the low-fi mockups and adressing the remaining pain points without further delay I started designing theinterface. </p>
                <h4>The Design System</h4>
                <p>Choosing a color for any design is always a tough task, unless the client prescribes something. We can't choose whatever color we want. Can we? Having the knowledge of color thoery and knowing the psychology of color and understanding the culture and comprehension of users is the best way to choose color for a design.</p>
                <p>I did UI analysis of competitive food ordering apps. It will give an idea of color threads used by other companies so we can avoid unnecessary plagiarism.</p>
                <p>I chose <strong>Orange </strong> as the primary color for the app. Orange is the color of joy and creativity. Orange promotes a sense of general wellness and emotional energy that should be shared, such as compassion, passion, and warmth. Studies show that the orange color can create physical effects such as increased hunger, heightened sense of activity, increased socialization, boost in aspiration, stimulated mental activity, increased oxygen supply to the brain, increased contentment, and enhanced assurance. Orange also helps aid decision making, and enhances happiness, confidence, and understanding.</p>

          <h4>UI Screens</h4>
          <p>Designing the UI of the app was of the toughest part. Including micro-interactions and every other feature the number of screens is more than 90. As this is a personal project and I was already over the deadline I confined the screen number to 30. I started sketching rough ideas on paper and I designed them in Adobe Illustrator. Most people use Adobe Photoshop for UI design, but I worked with vector graphics most of the time in my design career and am comfortable using Illustrator as I can work with images in Illustrator as well. After designing in Illustrator I used online downloaded mockup to frame the screens and Adobe XD for prototyping.</p>

           <h2>Learnings And Future Iterations</h2>
     
            <p>With <strong>Food's Here</strong>(un official redesign of Swiggy) I solved some reasonable problems and was very delighted to apply problem solving and design thinking during the whole process. Each phase in the design process has it's own problems and feasible solutions, for me the most challenging part was designing Hi-Fi UI mockups, I even minimized the screen count to 30,  but including micro interactions the count will approximately 90 and the most liked part was User Research, interacting with users and asking their thought process and watching them perform tasks is very informative for the Information Architecture. What users said and extra features can be shown but I minimized them because I was already 2 days over deadline, anything over that wouldn't be of any use even though I did it, so I skipped them. Although I didn't slack off during the 9 days I couldn't complete the full fledged design. The thoughts on my next project are to work more consistently and complete the project within the deadline. One of the main mistakes I did was to take the wrong perspective about the font size, while designing the font size was visible enough as I zoomed in through the screen, while after the project is completed and when I was viewing the screen in my mobile the font size  was rather less.</p>
            
            <p>I had a lot of fun and feel as though I learned a few new things
about the mental model of Food Ordering Services in general. From my experiments and failures, I learnt there was no traditional “right”
or “wrong” design decision, <strong>what matters is if it was appropriate for the project’s
context and constraints.</strong></p>
           
           <p>The more I jump into this field, the more I know that I don’t know many things on this
field. I might be able to prototype using XD, PSD, AI, but I admit my knowledge for
product strategy and business goal is still zero. But I will keep learning and grow each
day.</p>
            <p>Although I'm nowhere near good enough to give any fellow designer any suggestions but the things I found interesting and useful are </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do more  User Research and competitive product market analysis it helps a lot to understand present trends, needs and pain points. </li>
                <li>Whenever you're brainstorming for ideas always keep your mind fresh, well for everything. Note each and every idea it doesn't matter whether it helps or not you can combine those ideas or work on them later.</li>
                <li>Test your mockups and/or prototypes a looooot. You'll get insights from users perspective.</li>
            </ul>
            
                  <p>It was my love for food, people, and UX that motivated me to critically analyze and design <strong>Food's Here.</strong></p>
